N = new game | L = load | Q = quit


RULES:

Gameplay Style: The game is played in real-time, allowing the player to move freely without waiting for turns. Enemy ships spawn and move continuously on a timer-based system.

Game Over Conditions: Only one ship can occupy a square at a time. If the player attempts to move to a square already occupied by an enemy ship, it destroys it, but if surrounded by more than one enemy ships on neighboring squares, it results in a game over. This adds a strategic challenge to the game, requiring careful planning and movement.

Enemy Spawn Point: Enemy ships spawn from the top right of the screen. The player ship can also move to this location, but it's a risky strategy, as enemies emerging from the spawn point can quickly overwhelm and destroy the player ship, leading to a game over.

Sky Size: The game area is expanded to a 5x5 grid, providing the player with more room to maneuver and adding complexity to the gameplay.

Enemy Ship Types: While the game currently features only one type of enemy ship, each enemy ship has a "type" variable. This variable allows for potential expansion in the future, enabling the addition of more enemy ship types with unique characteristics and behaviors.
